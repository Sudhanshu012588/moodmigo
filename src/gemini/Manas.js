 21â€“34      | Moderate        | Notable symptoms present. Clinical assessment advised.
 35â€“44      | Severe          | Likely functional impairment. Strongly recommend professional care.
 45â€“50      | Critical        | Urgent concern, possible risk behaviours. Immediate mental health intervention needed.
